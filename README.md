# NewYorkCityLiving
Find the best place to live in NYC

In this project, I am finding the best places to live in New York City. With 5 boroughs and more than 300 neighborhoods, finding the right place to live can be a scary task. I am incorporating the ever popular crime data, school system data for those people with families, among other adjustable parameters. The goal of this project is to provide the user with information regarding favorable locations in NYC based on those inputted parameters.
